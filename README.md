NASA Hackathon 2020 Repo

“Take Off” is an interactive map of WA that allows users to learn more about local places that contribute to the work of space exploration and education. When a user clicks on a specific location, it provides a website where the user can get more information. We categorized the locations into the categories of "business", "academic", and "recreational", color-coding them accordingly. Underneath the map is information about why this resource is important and how space technology helps our communities, as well as information about local events, recent news, and a highlight of women from WA. Our target audience is students who come from groups underrepresented at NASA, which is women and BIPOC.
